        <h2>Generate a Seed Phrase / Guide</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                It is almost impossible to produce private, provably secure
                randomness with an electronic device. A seed phrase produced out
                of unsound randomness is insecure, and a flaw in the random
                number generation, either intentional or accidental, can take
                years to discover. By generating the seed phrase by hand, we
                eliminate any doubts about its security.

            <h3>Components</h3>

            <dd>Worksheet</dd>
            <dt>
                The worksheet has 2 sections: the <em>Binary sequence</em>, and
                the <em>Seed Phrase</em>. The binary sequence, comprising of `X`
                and `O`, is generated first. It is then converted into the seed
                phrase that is the proper wallet backup.
            </dt>

            <dd>Wordlist</dd>
            <dt>
                A list of all seed words as well as their binary value for
                conversion.
            </dt>

            <dd>Tiles</dd>
            <dt>
                The tiles are for generating a random binary sequence. There
                must be 2 tiles for each of the 29 characters, as well as as 2
                tiles for each of the 3 emojis.
            </dt>

            <h3>Steps Overview</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Generate a random binary sequence using the tiles.</li>
                <li>
                    Convert the binary sequence into seed words using the
                    wordlist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find the last word while entering the seed phrase into a
                    wallet by trying the 16 possible values for it.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Doing This Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete this activity in a private space.</li>
                <li>
                    Be careful to avoid pronouncing results or words out loud.
                </li>
                <li>Keep cameras and prying eyes away.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Generating the Random Binary Sequence</h3>

            <p>
                Tiles are a fast and reliable way to generate randomness
                <em>if they are well-shuffled</em>. The wash shuffle is similar
                to how children shuffle, i.e. by spreading the cards with both
                hands and mixing them arbitrarily. This is considered one of the
                most efficient ways to shuffle, and will ensure the security of
                the seed phrase. Note that this way of shuffling works best on a
                fabric surface.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Wash-shuffle the tiles thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Pick up a tile randomly.</li>
                <li>
                    In the table below, find the binary value corresponding to
                    the character on the tile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy this value into the "Binary Sequence" section of the
                    worksheet. Boxes color doesn't matter for this step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go back to step 1 and keep filling the 11 boxes of each line
                    until the sequence is complete, except for the 4 final boxes
                    marked with "?". Note that for the last tile, only the first
                    3 binary characters need to be copied.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h3>Converting the Binary Sequence into Seed Words</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the wordlist.</li>
                <li>
                    Convert each row of the binary sequence into its
                    corresponding seed word, and write these words in the
                    corresponding rows of the "Seed Phrase" section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For the last word, look for the section of the wordlist that
                    has its 16 words starting with the same sequence as the last
                    binary row.
                </li>
                <li>Take the wallet that will use the seed phrase.</li>
                <li>
                    On the wallet, initialize the recovery process and enter the
                    first 11 seed words.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then, try each of the 16 possible words starting with the
                    right binary sequence. Only one will be valid - this is the
                    12th word.
                </li>
                <li>Write down the 12th word on the worksheet.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Storing the Seed Phrase</h3>
            <p>
                Cut and store the "Seed Phrase" section in a secure location; If
                required this can function as a backup to restore the wallet. It
                is advised to keep this piece of paper into a protecting
                container, such as a stainless steel pill bottle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that you risk loosing your funds if the seed phrase
                is lost or stolen. For a safer and more resilient backup
                strategy, see the guide <em>Split a Seed Phrase (2-of-3)</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The "Binary Sequence" is no longer needed and must be disposed
                of securely, as it can also be used to take control of the
                wallet. The recommended way of doing so is to cut and burn that
                part completely.
