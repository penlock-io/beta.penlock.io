        <h2>Split a Seed Phrase (K-of-M) / Guide</h2>

        <aside>
            <em>Note:</em> Prior experience of the 2-of-3 guide is required.

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>
                While a 2-of-3 split is a good enough backup strategy, the
                K-of-M generalization is sometimes needed for sophisticated use
                cases such as social recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is worth noting that the K-of-M split uses a different
                algorithm, known as Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme. Compared to
                the 2-of-3 split, this method takes exponentially longer to
                perform as K (the number of shares needed for recovery) and M
                (the total number of shares) grows. However, the recovery time
                increases linearly.

                <dt>
                    The shares look the same as for the 2-of-3 split, but there
                    are now more of them. The concepts of "random shares" and
                    "derived shares" are similar, however an intermediary step
                    knows as "tweaked share" is now introduced. There are two
                    types of tweaking worksheets that should not be confused
                    with one another. The first are "Tweaking (derivation)"
                    sheets that are used to devire shares. The second is the
                    "Tweaking (recovery)" sheet, used for recovering the seed
                    phrase.

                <dt>
                    Two new wheels are needed in addition to the of the 2-of-M
                    wheel. The larger K-of-M wheel is for tweaking shares, and
                    the smaller one is used for recovery.

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <section>
                <dd>1. Fill the shares' headers</dd>
                <dt>
                    Begin with writing the group identifier on each random and
                    derived share (typically:
                    <em>"Brand Model MM/DD"</em>). Complete the scheme
                    parameters (e.g.: 3-of-5). Then, name the derived shares
                    following alphabetic order up to Z (C/D/E for 3-of-5). There
                    cannot be more than 26 shares in total.
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>2. Write the seed phrase</dd>
                <dt>
                    Fill the "Secret" section's gray fields with the seed
                    phrase, respecting the word's numbering.
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>3. Generate the random shares</dd>
                <dt>
                    Generate the random shares as explained in the 2-of-3 split
                    guide. The number of random shares depends on the recovery
                    threshold (the "K" in "K-of-M", minus one).
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>4. Checksum the secret and the random shares</dd>
                <dt>
                    Using the 2-of-M wheel, generate the checksums for the seed
                    phrase and the random shares as explained in the 2-of-3
                    split guide.
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>5. Generate the derived shares</dd>
                <dt>
                    Derive as many additional shares as needed to reach a total
                    of "M" random + derived shares. This will be done in two
                    phases - firstly, follow the section titled
                    <em>A1) Tweaking Shares for Derivation</em>, and then the
                    section titled <em>A3) Deriving from Tweaked Shares</em>.
                    Both processes are detailed below.
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>6. Verify the derived shares</dd>
                <dt>
                    Using the 2-of-M wheel, verify the checksum of each of the
                    derived share (this operation was explained in the 2-of-3
                    split guide). To fix erroneous characters, repeat the
                    various steps starting with the checksums on the random
                    shares, then the tweaking and finally the derivation.
                </dt>
            </section>

            <section>
                <dd>7. Recover the first seed phrase word</dd>
                <dt>
                    If you are using this guide for the first time, verify that
                    you completed each step correctly by recovering the first
                    seed word from the <em>derived</em> shares as explained in
                    <em>B1) Recovering the Seed Phrase</em> below. This will
                    also prove the soundness of the method.

            <h3>A1) Tweaking Shares for Derivation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the "Derivation Tables" sheet.</li>
                <li>Look for the correct table for your K-of-M.</li>
                <li>Look for the index (letter) of the share being derived.</li>
                <li>Take one of the "Tweaking (derivation)" worksheets.</li>
                <li>
                    For each share on the tweaking worksheet, write the
                    "Factor:" indicated in the derivation table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tweak each share as indicated in
                    <em>A2) Tweaking a Share</em> below.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <aside>
            <em>Example:</em> Tweaking shares to derive the share C, in a 3-of-5
            scheme. Look for the C column in the 3-of-M derivation table. The
            tweaking factor for "Secret" is 23, for "Share A" is 15, and for
            "Share B" is 26.
        </aside>

        <section>
            <h3>A2) Tweaking a Share</h3>
            <p>
                Tweaking a share consist of replacing its characters by the
                corresponding tweaked characters:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the big K-of-M wheel.</li>
                <li>
                    Place the pointer over the desired factor. The wheel
                    displays the character mapping for that tweaking factor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For each character of the share, write the corresponding
                    tweaked character at the corresponding position on the
                    tweaked share.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <aside>
                <em>Example:</em> Tweaking the word "COIN" by 18 will give
                "VDMT". First place the wheel pointer on 18, then look for the
                character "C", which will become a "V". Similarly, "O" leads to
                "D", "I" leads to "M" and "N" leads to "T".
            </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>A3) Deriving from Tweaked Shares</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the 2-of-M wheel.</li>
                <li>
                    Place the pointer on the first character of the first
                    tweaked share.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the inner row, find the first character of the second
                    tweaked share.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Move the pointer to the corresponding outer-row character.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat from step 3 with the first character of the remaining
                    tweaked shares.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write the character under the pointer as the first character
                    of the derived share.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat from step 1 with the second character of the first
                    tweaked share, and keep going until derivation is complete.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <aside>
                <em>Example:</em> Deriving from tweaked words "VDMT", "ABCD" and
                "WXYZ". Begin by deriving the first character. Place the pointer
                on "V", then look for "A" on the inner row. The corresponding
                outer-row character is "X". Move the pointer to "X". Look for
                "W" on the inner row. The corresponding outer-row character is
                "S". This is the first derived character. Repeat the process
                with the next characters to find the derived word "SCNW"

            <h3>B1) Recoving the Seed Phrase</h3>
            <p>
                Recovery can be achieved by deriving the secret (seed phrase +
                checksum) from the gathered shares. The tweaking factors have to
                be determined using both K-of-M wheels as explained later.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather K shares of the same group.</li>
                <li>
                    Tweak these shares as indicated in
                    <em>B2) Tweaking Shares for Recovery</em> just below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take a blank "Random Shares" worksheet where to write the
                    secret.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Derive the secret from the tweaked shares, as indicated in
                    <em>A3) Deriving from Tweaked Shares</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify the seed phrase's checksum as explained in the 2-of-3
                    guide. If erroneous characters are found, correct them by
                    repeating the recovery steps for these characters only.

            <h3>B2) Tweaking Shares for Recovery</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the "Tweaking (recovery)" worksheet.</li>
                <li>
                    Write the index of each share to tweak on the worksheet (in

                <li>
                    Look for the indexes of each of the <em>other</em> shares to

                <li>
                    The corresponding values as the tweaking factors for the

                <li>
                    If there are more factors to add, repeat from step 8 with

                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the resulting factor to tweak the first share as

            <aside>
                <em>Example:</em> Tweaking the shares A, C, E for recovery.
                Place the small K-of-M wheel pointer over A. The corresponding
                values for C and E are respectively 1 and 4. Write these as the
                factors for tweaking A. Place the big K-of-M wheel pointer over
                first factor: 1. Look for the "+5" label under the outer row.
                Place the pointer over the corresponding value: 6. Tweak the
                share A using that factor. Similarly, the tweaking factors for C
                and E are respectively 14+5=19 and 13+15=0.
